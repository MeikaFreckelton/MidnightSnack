As this game begins it will ask you for your name then greet you and print the title. It will then prompt you to type 's' to start. If you press something other than 's', it will print "Invalid" and you will be required to type s. It will then print the instructions and ask you if you would like to begin, again if you type something other than 'y' or 'n' it will tell you to try again. If you type 'n' it will print a game over message, if you type 'y' it will continue to the board and you will have to use the arrow keys to navigate through the path to find the snacks and avoid the obstacles, then you have to decide between a bed and their owner's face to sleep on. once finished, a congratulations message will be printed.
