| CLI argument - name             | Run the program from the terminal and write your name after.<br/>Eg. “ruby app.rb meika” | It should skip asking you for your name and print a greeting with your name. | Problem arised, but was handled. Now works as expected.      | It was a problem, as it would throw an error for using ‘gets’ later on in the program, this was fixed by inserting “ARGV.clear” afterwards. It is no longer a problem. |
| Welcome Screen                  | A screen which asks you for your name(if not given in CLI), prints the title gradually, and asks if you are ready to start. | Should ask for name and print greeting with name.

| Would you like to start?(s)     | Question asking if you are ready to start, have to press ‘s’. | When ‘s’ is pressed, screen should go to instructions, if something other than ‘s’ is pressed, invalid message will print, user will have to enter ‘s’. | As expected.                                                 | no                                                           |

| Would you like to start(y or n) | Question asking if you are ready to start, have to press ‘y’ or ‘n’. | When ‘y’ is pressed, game will begin. When ‘n’ is pressed game over message will print. When something else is print, error is handled and user is required to press ‘y’ or ‘n’. | As expected.                                                 | no                                                           |

It works now, although, because of the emojis the spacing in the board is inconsistent and looks messy, i am yet to find a solution to this problem. The board also moves when the emoji moves which i haven’t fixed yet. | Functionally, no, aesthetically, yes.                        |
| Emoji                           | Moving emoji with arrow keys.                                | Using the arrow keys the user may move the cat emojis across the spaces in the board. | I also spent a large amount of time on this trying to get it to work, studying other code and finally getting it to work. Although, I couldn’t find a solution to this myself, I looked at the way, the creator of the maze game shown in class achieved this, and tried to recreate that in my own way. | No                                                           |

| Obstacle messages               | Obstacle emojis scattered on board,Message prints when user is near. | When close to obstacles a warning message is printed to user. Can’t interact with them. | I tried to include the code for these messages in the same case statements used to move the objects, however it did not work and I had to create its own case. | No                                                           |
