## Statement of purpose and scope

##### What the game will do:

- The program will open, print text art of the title.
- It will print a greeting message and instructions - the user is informed they have to help the kitty find a midnight snack and help it get back to bed. Printed also is a list of commands the user may use, such as "q" to quit the game, "r" to restart the game, the arrow keys to navigate. 
- They then have to move the kitty (emoji) down the path (down the screen through a path that is made out of keyboard symbols (text art)).
- Different paths will appear to the kitty depending on which path they take, different obstacles will pop up as well as different foods to eat or even dead ends. 
- Different messages will be printed during the game depending on which paths the user takes, the obstacle at hand, the foods the cat eats and then when the kitty arrives at its bed.
- To exit the game, the user may pres "q" or they may choose to find the kitty's bed to put it to bed. If they choose to find a bed to put the kitty to bed they can either choose their own bed or sleep on their humans face.
- As a nice to have feature, everything the kitty eats will fill up a fullness meter and when the metre is full, a full message will be printed, if they go over the metre, the kitty will go into a food coma and the game will end.

##### The problem to be solved and why it is being developed:

This app is being developed to challenge myself and to see what I can do with the content I have learned and continue to learn.  As well as being immersed in the software development process to understand how it is done.

##### The target audience and how a member of the target audience will use it:

- The target audience for this project is other coders, to appreciate and understand the process, as well as a way to utilize and showcase my talents.
- It can also be enjoyed by all cat lovers.
- This project will be added to my Github where other coders can download it to their local terminal and play it.

## Features

##### Essential features

1. The user moves a cat emoji through a path printed on the screen, using their arrow keys to navigate. The path will be made out of keyboard symbols and will go down the screen, branching off onto different paths where different obstacles or foods will be. At the very end of the path there will be a bed which the user has to find and then put the kitty to bed when he is full.
2. Along the path that the user has to take, there will be obstacles and there will be food to eat. The food and the obstacles will be displayed as emojis(or text art). The obstacles will include other cats and a hole in the ground. The other cats may be angry and territorial, blocking you from entering a certain branch of the path. Or the other cats may be hungry as well and have food near them. The cat is still until the user approaches this other hungry cat, and it runs to eat the food, preventing you from getting it. The food items will include fishes in a pond, pieces of chicken and mice. When the user approaches the food it will disappear.
3. As the user is moving through the maze different text will print above the game depending on where the user is. Different messages will be printed as the user moves near obstacles, informing them of the obstacle and telling them what to do. Different messages will also be printed as the user moves near food items, informing them theyâ€™ve found a snack and telling them what to do. There are two options to put the kitty to bed: their own bed  or their humans face. When the user reaches the bed to put the kitty to sleep it will print a message asking if the user wants to put the kitty to sleep and end the game or keep looking for food, then it will print a finished message and ask if they want to restart the game.

##### Nice to have features

1. Fullness metre - increases based on foods eaten, if user goes over fullness metre, Mr kitty will go into a food coma and the game will end.
2. happiness metre - increases based on foods eaten and decreases based on obstacles hit, game may end when mr kitty is 100% happy. (Would eventually add other objects which will increase happiness)
3. hole portal - will allow for user to get the chicken that is hidden by an angry kitty. Holes may be secret portals or dangerous holes.
4. Emoji change - have the emoji change to sad cat face emoji when happiness metre is low or they encounter an obstacle.
5. Have harder levels - timed levels in which the foods and obstacles suddenly pop up to the user, more difficult.
6. Have music playing, to add intensity and increase engagement.
