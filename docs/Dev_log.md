#### Status update 11:17AM

I have encountered a significant issue while attempting to create my app. As the basic concept of my app is very similar to an example given by my educators I decided to try and learn how the creator of it managed the task. I studied the code and attempted to use it build a foundation for my board and learn how to move objects using arrow keys through a path. 

This was more difficult than I had thought and ended up spending a good chunk of time trying to understand it, as well as scouring the internet for solutions or ideas but with no luck. I finally understand it and have used it to build and format my own board. I will now try to create the code to get it to work myself in my own way.
