# Terminal App



## Statement of purpose and scope

##### What the game will do:

- The program will open, print text art of the title.
- It will print a greeting message and instructions - the user is informed they have to help the kitty find a midnight snack and help it get back to bed. Printed also is a list of commands the user may use, such as "q" to quit the game, "r" to restart the game, the arrow keys to navigate. ###
- They then have to move the kitty (emoji) down the path (down the screen through a path that is made out of keyboard symbols (text art)).
- Different paths will appear to the kitty depending on which path they take, different obstacles will pop up as well as different foods to eat or even dead ends. 
- Different messages will be printed during the game depending on which paths the user takes, the obstacle at hand, the foods the cat eats and then when the kitty arrives at its bed.
- To exit the game, the user may pres "q" or they may choose to find the kitty's bed to put it to bed. If they choose to find a bed to put the kitty to bed they can either choose their own bed or sleep on their humans face.
- As a nice to have feature, everything the kitty eats will fill up a fullness meter and when the metre is full, a full message will be printed, if they go over the metre, the kitty will go into a food coma and the game will end.

##### The problem to be solved and why it is being developed:

This app is being developed to challenge myself and to see what I can do with the content I have learned and continue to learn.  As well as being immersed in the software development process to understand how it is done.

##### The target audience and how a member of the target audience will use it:

- The target audience for this project is other coders, to appreciate and understand the process, as well as a way to utilize and showcase my talents.
- This project will be added to my Github where other coders can download it to their local terminal and play it.

## Features

1. The user moves a cat emoji through a path printed on the screen, using their arrow keys to navigate. The path will be made out of keyboard symbols and will go down the screen, branching off onto different paths where different obstacles or foods will be. At the very end of the path there will be a bed which the user has to find and then put the kitty to bed when he is full.(75 words)
2. Along the path that the user has to take, there will be obstacles and there will be food to eat. The food and the obstacles will be displayed as emojis(or text art). The obstacles will include other cats and a hole in the ground. The other cats may be angry and territorial, blocking you from entering a certain branch of the path. Or the other cats may be hungry as well and have food near them. The cat is still until the user approaches this other hungry cat, and it runs to eat the food, preventing you from getting it. The food items will include fishes in a pond, pieces of chicken and mice. When the user approaches the food it will disappear.(123 words)
3. As the user is moving through the maze different text will print above the game depending on where the user is. Different messages will be printed as the user moves near obstacles, informing them of the obstacle and telling them what to do. Different messages will also be printed as the user moves near food items, informing them theyâ€™ve found a snack and telling them what to do. There are two options to put the kitty to bed: their own bed  or their humans face. When the user reaches the bed to put the kitty to sleep it will print a message asking if the user wants to put the kitty to sleep and end the game or keep looking for food, then it will print a finished message and ask if they want to restart the game.(121 words)

nice to have features:

1. fullness metre - based on foods eaten
2. happiness metre - based on foods eaten and obstacles hit
3. hole portal - allows for user to get chicken hidden by angry kitty
4. have emoji change to sad cat face emoji when near obstacles
5. have different and harder levels
6. have music playing
7. have a timer
8. have the foods and obstacles pop up suddenly 



## User interaction and experience

At the beginning of the game, after a welcome message is printed, instructions informing the user how to navigate through the game will be given. Additionally, throughout the game, promts will appear, giving further specific instructions. The user will use the arrow keys to navigate through the game, the user will also be able to enter "q" to quit and exit the game and "r" to restart the game. If errors are raised during gameplay, they will be handled by the program and an appropriate error message will be displayed to the user. For example, if the user accidentally presses something other than an arrow key during the navigation it will print "Not an arrow key, try again".
